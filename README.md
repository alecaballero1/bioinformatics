This file includes 6 different functions for bioinformatic analysing, made in different modules for my university classes

1. Find multiple genes:
      - Requires BioPython
      - Provide a genome set vs a text file of genes you'd like to identify
2. DNA complementer:
      - Requires BioPython
      - Creates a dictionary of complementary DNA bases
      - Insert a sequence and get its complementary, has to be DNA seq
3. Includes mini functions:
      - Length of seq
      - Presence of subsequences
      - CG percentage
      - AG counter
4. FASTA and GENBANK downloader:
      - Requires BioPython
      - Download FASTA files
      - Analyse FASTA files
      - Download GB files
5. Feature counts in GENBANK:
      - Requires BioPython, pandas and collections
      - Analyse GB files
      - Manage Databases
6. VENN diagrams:
